# About me

Since I was young, I was very interested in computers, I even learned how to make batch scripts in a simple Orkut community, when I was 16, and I liked to automate small routine tasks.

Another great curiosity I had was to understand how the things of my daily life worked inside, that's why I wanted to enter the world of engineering.

The two things started to meet when I took the first subject outside my academic curriculum, which was embedded systems. It was there that I really found myself, so much that I am in this area to this day.

My professional fascination is to see the sum of mathematical theory, physics through computing promoting ease in people's daily lives.
